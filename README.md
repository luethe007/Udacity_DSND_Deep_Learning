## Project: Create an AI Application - Image Classifier

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
- [Torchvision](http://pytorch.org/)
- [PIL](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

The code has been created as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

Files:
- build.py: builds the deep learning model and loads the latest checkpoint
- data.py: loads and transforms data for the deep learning model
- predict.py: preprocessing of the image and class prediction
- train.py: trains, tests and saves neural net
- Image Classifier Project.html: Jupyter Notebook containing all previously mentioned steps.
